				<h2><b>Useful extensions to consider</b>

						Here is a list of recommended basic extensions, and that you might find useful to look into for your Vim journey:

						  *  Ctrlp: Hitting Ctrl+P will allow you to use fuzzy 					search to find your files

						  *  Snipmate: Allows storing snippets and using them on the fly in your files

						  *  Emmet: Provides support for expanding abbreviations similar to emmet

						That was a summary of what I have learned so far about Vim, hopefully its clear enough for beginners to checkout out and learn a thing or two from it.

						Whether you are a beginner or an experienced Vim user, I would love to hear your feedback on this piece, make sure to share your thoughts in the comments below. Happy Vimming!
