				<h2><b>Useful extensions to consider</b>

						Here is a list of recommended basic extensions, and that you might find useful to look into for your Vim journey:

						  *  Ctrlp: Hitting Ctrl+P will allow you to use fuzzy 					search to find your files

						  *  Snipmate: Allows storing snippets and using them on the fly in your files

						  *  Emmet: Provides support for expanding abbreviations similar to emmet

						That was a summary of what I have learned so far about Vim, hopefully its clear enough for beginners to checkout out and learn a thing or two from it.

						Whether you are a beginner or an experienced Vim user, I would love to hear your feedback on this piece, make sure to share your thoughts in the comments below. Happy Vimming!
				<h2>Useful tips	</h2>

						<p>-
						 Escape remap! Escape is too far away from the usual keys, I'm using jj instead.
							- Don't modify your .vimrc without understanding what you are doing. Begin with the default and customize it step by step.

							- NERDTree plugin for file navigation
							- Try using a comfortable color scheme to improve your experience. Here you have tons of options https://github.com/flazz/vim-c...
